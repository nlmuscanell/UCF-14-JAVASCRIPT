# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Automatic Table and Date Search

A basic HTML web page was created to host data on UFO sightings. The UFO dataset consisted of an array of JavaScript objects. JavaScript code was written to appends a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting. JavaScript code was also included to listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Multiple Search Categories

JavaScript code was created to add multiple `input` tags, allowing the user to set multiple filters (simultaneously) to search for UFO sightings. These filters included are: date/time, city, state, country, and sighiting shape.
