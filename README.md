# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Automatic Table and Date Search

A basic HTML web page was created. A UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.I also used a date form and wrote JavaScript code that listened for events and searched through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Multiple Search Categories

I wrote JavaScript code that would add multiple `input` tags, and allows the user to set multiple filters (simultaneously) to search for UFO sightings. These filters included: date/time, city, state, country, and sighiting shape.
